## Part 1: London's Underground Resilience




## Part 2: Spatial Interaction Models

In the second part, we will analyse the OD matrix of the London Underground.

### Models and Calibration

The family of spatial interaction models are as follows:

**The unconstrained model** only constrains the model with matching the total flows with the observed value.

$$
T_{ij} = K O^{\alpha}_i D^{\gamma}_j f(c_{ij})
$$

**The singly constrained model** constrains the total number of observations for each component at the origin or the destination.


The dataset used for analysis have the following data for every origin-destination pair for the London Underground Stations.

- population of origin
- jobs at the destination
- distance between origin and destination
- flow from the origin to the destination

First, we will use the doubly constrained model to calibrate the parameters by comparing with the observed flow.

#### Scenarios

The scenarios we will observe in this report are as follows:

| Scenario | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scenario A | Jobs at Canary Wharf decrease by 50 % |
| Scenario B | Increase in cost of transport - considering 2 parameters |

: The scenarios to the status quo explored in this report.
