## Part 1: London's Underground Resilience

The first part of this report addresses the resilience of the London Underground using network analysis.

### Topological Network {#sec-topological}

In this section, the topological network of the London Underground is analysed, without considering the passenger flows. The weight of each edge is the geographic distance of lines between station pairs.

#### Centrality Measures

Centrality measures are characteristics of nodes indicating their significance in various aspects. In this report, the measures used to identify significant stations are: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. The number of nodes within the network is denoted by $n$, and the number of links between nodes $i$ and $j$ as $A_{ij}$.

**Degree centrality** is the number of links that are connected to each node. The degree centrality $k_i$ for node $i$ is calculated as

$$
k_i = \sum_{j} A_{ij}
$$ {#eq-degree-centrality}

In the context of the underground network, the degree corresponds to the number of directions that serves the station. Since our dataset does not double count two lines serving the same two station pairs, this is equivalent to the number of adjacent stations. 

@tbl-degree shows stations with the highest degree centrality. A high degree centrality indicates there are many lines serving the station, quantifying the importance as a transit hub allowing for transfers.

| Rank | Station | Degree |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Stratford | 9 |
| 2 | Bank and Monument | 8 |
| 3 | Baker Street | 7 |
| 3 | King's Cross St. Pancras | 7 |
| 5 | Earl's Court | 6 |
| 5 | Canning Town | 6 |
| 5 | Liverpool Street | 6 |
| 5 | Green Park | 6 |
| 5 | Oxford Circus | 6 |
| 5 | Waterloo | 6 |
| 5 | West Ham | 6 |

: Stations with the highest degree centrality. All stations tied at a degree of 6 are listed. {#tbl-degree}

**Betweenness centrality** of a node is the number of shortest paths that run through the node. The betweenness centrality $x_i$ for node $i$ is calculated as 

$$
x_i = \sum_{s,t} \frac{n^i_{st}}{g_{st}}
$$ {#eq-betweenness-centrality}

where

$$
n^i_{st} = 
\begin{cases}
1 \quad (\text{if node } i \text{ is on geodesic from } s \text{ to }t)\\
0 \quad (\text{otherwise})
\end{cases}
$$

and $g_{st}$ is the total number of geodesic paths from $s$ to $t$. This can be normalised by dividing by $(n-1)(n-2)/2$ (combinations between remaining nodes) to obtain a range between 0 and 1. A station with high betweenness centrality is on the shortest path between many origin-destination pairs of stations, therefore many people are expected to pass it, indicating its importance. The stations with the highest betweenness centrality are shown in @tbl-betweenness.

| Rank | Station | Betweenness Centrality |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Bank and Monument | 17,625 |
| 2 | King's Cross St. Pancras | 16,716 |
| 3 | Stratford | 14,563 |
| 4 | Baker Street | 13,180 |
| 5 | Oxford Circus | 12,573 |
| 6 | Euston | 12,345 |
| 7 | Earl's Court | 11,452 |
| 8 | Shadwell | 11,127 |
| 9 | Waterloo | 10,425 |
| 10 | South Kensington | 10,302 |

: Stations with the highest betweenness centrality. {#tbl-betweenness}

**Closeness centrality** is the inverse of the mean geodesic distance from one node to other reachable $n_0$ nodes ($l_i$) in the same connected component. This value is scaled by the ratio of reachable nodes to account for connectedness, as proposed by @wasserman1994. The closeness centrality $C_i$ is calculated as 

$$
C_i = \frac{n_0-1}{n-1} \cdot \frac{1}{l_i} = \frac{(n_0-1)^2}{(n-1) \sum_{j} d_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-closeness-centrality}

where $d_{ij}$ is the geodesic distance between nodes $i$ and $j$.

A high closeness centrality indicates the station is within a short distance from all the other stations. These stations are located within the city centre, as the high-ranked stations clustered in central London shown in @tbl-closeness.

| Rank | Station | Closeness Centrality [$\times 10^{-5}$] |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Holborn | 7.924 |
| 2 | King's Cross St. Pancras | 7.907 |

| 6 | Picadilly Circus | 7.831 |
| 7 | Charing Cross | 7.830 |
| 8 | Chancery Lane | 7.823 |
| 9 | Covent Garden | 7.806 |
| 10 | Embankment | 7.799 |

: Stations with the highest closeness centrality. Charing Cross is where the 'distance to London' is measured from [@leatherdale2016] - supporting that these stations are located in the city centre. {#tbl-closeness}

#### Impact Measures

For measuring the impact of node removal, we have used the delta centrality measure proposed by @latora2007. This quantifies the change in performance of the network when a node is removed. For a performance measure $P$ of the network $G$, the delta centrality $C^{\Delta}_i$ of node $i$ is defined as

$$
C^{\Delta}_i = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{P(G) - P(G')}{P(G)} \quad (G': G \text{ after removing node }i)
$$

The performance measures considered are summarised in @tbl-delta-performance. 

| Performance Measure $P$ | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Size of Largest Connected Component (LCC) | The size of LCC shows the connectedness of the network. A smaller number indicates many stations are disconnected from the main network, resulting in less connectess. |
| Network Efficiency $E(G) = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{1}{d_{ij}}$ | Efficiency measure proposed by @latora2001. A high value indicates lower shortest path lengths between nodes. This measure is applicable for disconnected networks as well, unlike the average shortest path length. Since the `nx.global_efficiency()` function cannot incorporate edge length, a custom function was defined to calculate this value. |

: Performance measures considered for delta centrality. {#tbl-delta-performance tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}

Applications can be found within and beyond transport networks - closures of NYC subway stations after 9/11 [@wyatt2002; @paaswell2012] is one example of analysing transport networks. In other contexts, @broder2000 analysed the early worldwide web from the size of (strongly) connected components, and @achard2007 is an example of applying the network efficiency measure to the human brain. These examples indicate the global applicability of impact measures.

#### Node Removal

The measures in @tbl-delta-performance is used to analyse the impact of node removal. Two strategies shown in @tbl-removal-strategies are used to remove 10 nodes from the network. The stations removed are shown in @tbl-removed-stations.

| Strategy | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Non-sequential Removal | Removes nodes in order that appears in the original rank table (@tbl-degree, @tbl-betweenness, and @tbl-closeness). |
| Sequential Removal | Recalculates centrality on the deformed network after each node removal, and determines the next node to remove based on the recalculated centrality. |

##### Discussions {.unnumbered}

The sequential removal is more effective to study resilience of the network compared to non-sequential removal. Since the characteristics of the network change upon node removal, the crucial node may also change when re-evaluating the remaining network. By assessing the importance of node at each step, the sequential removal is capable of identifying nodes that gain importance after the initial deformation.

Node removal based on the betweenness centrality has the largest impact on performance. Since a high betweenness centrality indicates many geodesics passing the node, removing this node will force many paths to divert to different routes. Interestingly, the degree centrality has identified the first few stations with larger impact. Further investigation is required to identify whether this is a general trend or specific to the Underground network.

When comparing between impact measures, the efficiency is a better evaluation of the performance. The size of LCC is unable to assess the impact of station removal unless it disconnects nodes from the network, whereas the efficiency can assess the change within a connected network, thus the impact is more sensitively reported. Comparing the observations, the LCC shows little change except when removing hub stations that disconnect branches, where efficiency gives a continuous evaluation of performance.

### Flows: Weighted Network {#sec-weighted}

In this section, a weighted network considering the passenger flows is analysed. Based on the morning peak origin-destination data from @transportforlondon2021, flows have been assigned to the shortest path between nodes considering the length of each edge. The flow is either used to weight origin-destination pairs or used directly as the weight of edges between stations.

#### Centrality Measures

First, we have considered whether centrality measures in @sec-topological need adjustments to be applied to the weighted network. The adjustments made for the weighted measures are summarised in @tbl-weighted-centrality-measures.

| Centrality measure | Weighted measure | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Degree Centrality | Strength $s_i = \sum_j A_{ij}w_{ij}$ | $w_{ij}$ is the flow on link between nodes $i$ and $j$. A measure discussed as the strength $s_i$ in @lee2008, quantifying the amount of flow on edges connected to the node. This measure is highly related to the betweenness centrality, since they both address the flows involving the node. The unweighted degree centrality is a valid measure in a weighted network as well. |
| Betweenness Centrality | Weighted Betweenness Centrality $x'_i = \sum_{st} \frac{n^i_{st}}{g_{st}}T_{st}$ | $T_{ij}$ as the number of flows from $i$ to $j$. The betweenness centrality, weighting each origin-destination pair by the number of flows. |
| Closenese Centrality | Harmonic Weighted Closeness Centrality $C''_i = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_j \frac{1}{u_{ij}}$ | When considering the inverse of flows as the **social distance** between nodes, $u_{ij}$ is defined as the smallest social distance between nodes $i$ and $j$. A harmonic mean was used to account for edges with zero flow (infinite social distance). Simply giving the weight $T_{ij}$ in @eq-closeness-centrality as $C'_i = \frac{\sum_j T_{ij}}{\sum_j T_{ij}d_{ij}}$ gives the average distance travelled by the user of the station, which is difficult to interpret from the perspective of importantness. ($C'_i$ may be larger in the city centre attracting people from longer distances, or at the outskirts where passengers need to travel long distances in general.) |

: Adjustments made for each centrality measure on the weighted network. {#tbl-weighted-centrality-measures tbl-colwidths="[20,25,55]"}

Comparing the weighted degree and betweenness centralities in @tbl-weighted-centrality-measures, their difference lies in whether it counts journeys that originate or terminate at the node in question, and whether it double-counts flows that pass through the node. Thus, their relationship can be expressed as  

$$
s_i = 2x'_i + (O_i + D_i - T_{ii})
$$ {#eq-bet-weighted2}

where $O_i, D_i$ is the number of flows originating and terminating at node $i$.

Based on the above measures, we have examined the stations with high weighted centrality measures.

The stations with the highest weighted degree centrality is shown in @tbl-weighted-degree.

| Rank | Station | Weighted Degree (Strength) $(\times 10^5)$ |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Bank and Monument | 5.188 |
| 2 | Oxford Circus | 4.889 |
| 3 | King's Cross St. Pancras | 4.671 |
| 4 | Baker Street | 3.358 |
| 5 | Waterloo | 3.344 |
| 6 | Euston | 3.164 |
| 7 | Green Park | 3.143 |
| 8 | Victoria | 2.947 |
| 9 | Liverpool Street | 2.770 |
| 10 | Embankment | 2.539 |

: Stations with the highest weighted degree centrality. {#tbl-weighted-degree}

6 out of 10 stations in this table also appear in @tbl-degree, while terminal stations such as Euston and Victoria are unique to this list.

The **betweenness centrality** considering flows, given $T_{ij}$ as the number of flows from node $i$ to $j$, can be proposed as follows:

$$
x'_i = \sum_{st} \frac{n^i_{st}}{g_{st}}T_{st}
$$ {#eq-bet-weighted}

 The stations with the highest weighted betweenness centrality values are calculated as shown in @tbl-weighted-betweenness.

| Rank | Station | Weighted Betweenness Centrality $(\times 10^5)$ |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Oxford Circus | 4.415 |

| 9 | Charing Cross | 2.277 |
| 10 | Victoria | 2.236 |

: Stations with the highest weighted betweenness centrality. {#tbl-weighted-betweenness}

6 out of 10 stations are also highly ranked in the unweighted measure in @tbl-betweenness. Because of the similarity between the weighted degree centrality, 9 out of 10 stations in @tbl-weighted-betweenness appear in @tbl-weighted-degree as well. 

The stations with high harmonic weighted closeness centrality values are shown in @tbl-weighted-closeness.

| Rank | Station | Harmonic Weighted Closeness Centrality |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Bank and Monument | 68.816 |
| 2 | Liverpool Street | 66.250 |
| 3 | Stratford | 65.282 |
| 4 | Waterloo | 64.690 |
| 5 | Green Park | 63.928 |

| 7 | Moorgate | 62.571 |
| 8 | Oxford Circus | 61.793 |
| 9 | Westminster | 61.636 |
| 10 | Baker Street | 61.169 |

: Stations with the highest weighted harmonic closeness centrality. {#tbl-weighted-closeness}

These stations are not geographically concentrated compared to @tbl-closeness. Terminal stations with high originating or terminating journeys, or stations connected by high-flowing edges are highly ranked in this measure. King's Cross St. Pancras and Oxford Circus are the only stations that appear in both @tbl-closeness and @tbl-weighted-closeness. 

#### Impact Measures

We have considered the need for adjusting the impact measures in @tbl-delta-performance for the weighted network. When considering the weight, each measure should be adjusted as summarised in @tbl-delta-performance-weighted.

| Original Performance Measure | Weighted Equivalent | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size of LCC | Ratio of journeys within same connected component $J(G)$ | Drawing the principle of LCC by considering whether two nodes are within the same connected component. Weighting this by the flows between each node pair, resulting in measuring the ratio of journeys that can be completed within a connected component. Note that the size of LCC is also valid in a weighted network, although unable to consider flows. |
| Network Efficiency | Weighted Network Efficiency $E'(G)$ | Each distance between node pairs weighted according to the number of passengers travelling between them, calculating the average inverted distance of journeys. |

: Adjustments for the impact measures for a weighted network. {#tbl-delta-performance-weighted tbl-colwidths="[20,20,60]"}

$J(G)$ and $E'(G)$ are calculated as shown in @eq-ratio-connected-journeys and @eq-weighted-efficiency respectively.

$$
J(G) = \frac{\sum_{i \ne j} (T_{ij} \delta_{ij})}{T} \quad
\left( \delta_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1 \text{ if nodes } i \text{ and } j \text{ are connected} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\right)
$$ {#eq-ratio-connected-journeys}

$$
E(G) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{T_{ij}}{d_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-weighted-efficiency}

#### Node Removal

The best performing methodology in @sec-weighted was the sequential removal using betweenness centrality. The unweighted and weighted variants removes stations shown in @tbl-node-removal-betweenness.

| Rank | Unweighted | Weighted |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Bank and Monument | Oxford Circus |
| 2 | King's Cross St. Pancras | King's Cross St. Pancras |
| 3 | Canada Water | Bank and Monument |

: Stations removed using the highest unweighted and weighted betweenness centrality. Stations for the unweighted centrality is extracted from @tbl-removed-stations-2. {#tbl-node-removal-betweenness}

The changes in the performance using $J(G), E(G)$ for each strategy are shown in @fig-weighted-performance. Comparing these results, removing stations based on the unweighted measure has the most impact on the network. The weighted efficiency has dropped significantly, indicating journeys are taking longer or disconnected in the nodes-removed network. Thus, the stations that have the most impact on the performance of the network are: Bank and Monument, King's Cross St. Pancras, and Stratford.

![Change in the performance measures as a result of node removal according to the weighted and unweighted betweenness centrality.](img/weighted_node_removal_measures.png){#fig-weighted-performance}

The weighted strategy takes into account the flows of passengers, but did not outperform the unweighted strategy. One possible explanation is due to the characteristics of the stations removed: the weighted strategy removes stations near the city centre with dense networks allowing for minimal diversions, while the unweighted strategy removes the suburban transit hub of Stratford that immediately disconnects branches, highly impacting performance measures. A further investigation is necessary for a more accurate comparison; continuing the removal may give additional insights.

## Part 2: Spatial Interaction Models

In the second part, we have analysed the morning-peak passenger flows of the London Underground, following a brief introduction of the spatial interaction model.

### Models and Calibration

#### Family of Spatial Interaction Models

The spatial interaction model predicts the flow between origin and destination from the amount of activity at both ends and the distance between them, drawing an analogy from Newton's law of gravity [@waddell2002]. Spatial interaction models are classified by the constraints cast on them deriving from actual observations; whether the amount of originating and terminating journeys of nodes are preserved.

In this section, the variables will be denoted as follows:

- $T_{ij}$: estimated flow from station $i$ to $j$
- $T$: total flow within a network, thus $T = \sum_{i,j} T_{ij}$
- $d_{ij}$: distance between stations $i$ and $j$ - the cost function is a function of $d_{ij}$ hence denoted as $f(d_{ij})$
- $O_i$, $D_j$: activity at the origin and destination that impacts the originating and terminating flows

In this model,  $O_i$ and $D_j$ are the number of total journeys from / to the node. As we are analysing the data for the morning peak, $O_i$ corresponds to the population that uses the station and $D_j$ to the number of jobs around the node.

The **unconstrained model** only constrains the model with matching the total flows with the observed value, calculated as:

$$
T_{ij} = K O^{\alpha}_i D^{\gamma}_j f(c_{ij}) \quad \left (K = \frac{T}{\sum_i \sum_j O^{\alpha}_i D^{\gamma}_j f(d_{ij})} \right)
$$ {#eq-unconst}

$K$ is determined so that the total flow $T$ is preserved. The unconstrained model is used when there is information on the total amount of journeys but no detailed information is available.

The **singly constrained model** constrains the total number of observations for each component at the origin or the destination. The **origin constrained model**, shown in @eq-orig, is a singly constrained model that fixes the total number of journeys at the origin.

$$
T_{ij} = A_i O_i D^{\gamma}_j f(d_{ij})
$$ {#eq-orig}

The parameter $A_i$ is determined so that the total at the origin is constrained.

$$
\sum_j T_{ij} = O_i \therefore A_i = \frac{1}{\sum_j D^{\gamma}_j f(d_{ij})}
$$ {#eq-orig-ai}

This model is widely used for flow prediction in various use-cases, including deciding the location and size for retail developments based on the residential distribution within a certain area [@haynes2020].

Similarly, the **destination constrained model** constrains the total at the destination, where the flows are calculated by @eq-dest.

$$
T_{ij} = O^{\alpha}_i B_j D_j f(c_{ij}) \quad
\text{where } \left (B_j = \frac{1}{\sum_i O^{\alpha}_i f(c_{ij})} \right)
$$ {#eq-dest}

This can be used for predicting flows from origins given a particular destination, such as estimating the impact of a new development within a city [@haynes2020].

The **doubly constrained model** constrains both the total at the origin and destination.

$$
T_{ij} = A_i O_i B_j D_j \exp(-\beta d_{ij})
$$ {#eq-dbl}

This is used in the transport planning context as a method of trip distribution in the 4-step method, estimating flows based on activity of both ends [@robinson2011]. 

#### Calibration of Parameters

In this report, an origin-constrained model is used to simulate the different scenarios. This is justified in @sec-scenarios. The dataset used for analysis have the following data for every London Underground Station.

- population of origin
- jobs at the destination
- distance between origin and destination
- flow from the origin to the destination

For the calibration process, we will first use the doubly constrained model to estimate the best cost function and parameters by comparing with the observed flow. Then, the origin-constrained model required for the scenarios are used to calibrate the $\gamma$ parameter. For the cost function, constraining both the total journeys for both the origin and destination will enable the full utilisation of observed data, enabling the most accurate calibration. The $\gamma$ parameter does not appear in the doubly constrained model, and is required to calibrate in the origin-constrained model. 

##### Calibration of the cost function {.unnumbered}

The Poisson model [@flowerdew1982] of the doubly constrained model @eq-dbl is written as:

$$
\ln(T_{ij}) = \ln A_i + \ln O_i + \ln B_j + \ln D_j + \ln f(d_{ij}) \\
$$

For the cost function $f(d_{ij})$, the negative exponential and inverse power functions are compared (@eq-cost-function) to determine the better performing relationship and the optimal parameter $\beta$. The results are shown in @tbl-beta.

$$
f(d_{ij}) = 
\begin{cases}
\exp(-\beta d_{ij}) \text{ (Negative Exponential)} \\
d^{-\beta}_{ij}  \text{ (Inverse Power)} 
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-cost-function}

| Cost Function | Parameter $\beta$ | $R^2$ value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Negative exponential $f(d_{ij}) = \exp(-\beta d_{ij})$ | $\beta = 1.543 \times 10^{-4}$ | $R^2 = 0.4979$ |
| Inverse Power $f(d_{ij}) = d^{-\beta}_{ij}$ | $\beta = 9.096 \times 10^{-1}$ | $R^2 = 0.4077$ |

: Comparison of results for the doubly constrained model using inverse power and negative exponential cost functions. {#tbl-beta}

Since the negative exponential model (@eq-beta) has a better fit to the observed flows, this is used in the rest of the analysis.

$$
f(d_{ij}) = \exp(-\beta d_{ij}) \quad (\beta = -1.543 \times 10^{-4})
$$ {#eq-beta}

##### Calibration of $\gamma$ {.unnumbered}

Since the origin-constrained model was used for the analysis of the scenarios, the gamma variable must be calibrated before applying to the new scenarios. @eq-orig is transformed into a Poisson Model as follows:

$$
\ln(T_{ij}) = \ln A_i + \ln O_i + \gamma \ln D_j + \ln f(d_{ij}) \\
$$ {#eq-orig-poisson}

$\gamma$ with the highest R-squared value was used, resulting as follows:

$$
\gamma = 7.556 \times 10^{-1} \quad (R^2 = 0.4680)
$$ {#eq-gamma}

### Scenarios {#sec-scenarios}

The scenarios we have considered are summarised in @tbl-scenarios.

| Scenario | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scenario A | Jobs at Canary Wharf decrease by 50 % |
| Scenario B | Increase in cost of transport - considering 2 parameters |

: The scenarios explored in this report {#tbl-scenarios tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

Since scenario A involves the change in the characteristics of the destination, the origin constrained model is used for the analysis to preserve the number of commuters starting their journeys in each area. The same model was used for scenario B and the original state for a fair comparison between scenarios.

#### Scenario A

We have first decreased the number of jobs at Canary Wharf by 50% from $D_j$ to $D'_j$ (@eq-halfdj). We have observed how the destination of commuters changed in reaction to this decrease using the origin-constrained model (@eq-orig-poisson).

$$
D'_j = \frac{D_j}{2}
$$ {#eq-halfdj}

$A_i$ needs to be adjusted so that the new parameter $A'_i$ fulfills @eq-orig-ai-adj, ensuring the total flows that originate from each station is conserved.

$$
A'_i = \frac{1}{\sum_j D'^{\gamma}_j f(d_{ij})}
$$ {#eq-orig-ai-adj}

Finally, the new flows $T'_{ij}$ is estimated as shown below, derived from @eq-orig.

$$
T'_{ij} = A'_i O_i D'^{\gamma}_j \exp(-\beta d_{ij})
$$

As a result, a significant drop in the number of journeys terminating at Canary Wharf was observed, from 47,690 in total to 29,496 (61.9 % of original flow). As observable from @fig-OD-scenarioA, the decrease in the flows to Canary Wharf occured evenly among all origins, and were redistributed into other destinations.

#### Scenario B

We have considered the increase of cost in this scenario, using two scenarios B1 and B2 each modifying the cost functions $\beta_1, \beta_2$ as shown in @eq-paramsB and illstrated in @fig-paramsB. 

$$
\begin{cases}
\beta_1 = 2 \beta \\
\beta_2 = 10 \beta
\end{cases}
\quad (\beta = -1.543 \times 10^{-4})
$$ {#eq-paramsB}

The new flows for this scenario was calcuated following the same parameter-recalibration process in scenario A. The flows between origin-destination pairs plotted by distance of journeys are shown in @fig-OD-scenarioB. As the $\beta$ increases, the longer distance journeys have lower frequency compared to the original scenario.

#### Discussion

In order to examine flow change and to compare between scenarios, measurements in @tbl-measurements were calculated.

| Measurement | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quantity of change in destination $T_{\text{diff}} = \frac{\sum_{i,j} |T'_{ij} - T_{ij}|}{2}$ | The number of flows that have different destinations than the original scenario. ($T'_{ij}$ is the number of journeys from station $i$ to $j$ under the scenario.) A larger change in destinations indicate larger impact on the movement of people within the underground network. |
| Mean distance of journeys $\bar{\delta} = \frac{\sum_{i,j}\left(T_{ij}d_{ij}\right)}{T}$ | The mean distance of all journeys simulated in each scenario. A larger change in the distance compared to the original simulation indicate larger impact. |

For each scenario, values for these measurements are calculated as shown in @tbl-measure-scenarios. 

| Scenario | $T_{\text{diff}}$|  $T_{\text{diff}} / T$ [%] | $\bar{\delta}$ [m] |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| *Original Simulation* | - | *(Total flows: 1,542,283)* | *8,583* |
| Scenario A | 18,193 | 1.2 % of total flows | 8,579 |
| Scenario B1 | 346,503 | 22.47 % of total flows | 6,030 |
| Scenario B2 | 1,222,191 | 79.25 % of total flows | 1,613 |

$T_{\text{diff}}$ and $\bar{\delta}$ both indicate that scenario B2 had the largest impact on the number of flows, and scenario A the least impactful. 

The intervention to the travel cost (scenario B) directly impacts all origin-destination pairs, while the reduction of jobs in one area (scenario A) only impacts journeys that end at the station affected. This different nature of the interventions dictate the magnitude of change it causes; thus scenario B has a larger impact on the flows on the network as a whole. 

Recalling the impact of scenario A on Canary Wharf was a 39 % decrease in the total inflows, which falls between scenarios B1 and B2 in terms of $T_{\text{diff}}$. Even focusing on one station, it is rational to conclude scenario B2 has the largest impact.

In conclusion, a drastic impact on the cost function has more impact throughout the network compared to a large change in the demand in a particular area. 
Further analysis can be done using the actual changes in the underground fares as a natural experiment, comparing with predicted results in a replicated scenario.
