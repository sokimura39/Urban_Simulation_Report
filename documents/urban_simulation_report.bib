  abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task or ``resting'' state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06--0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties---supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost---which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

  abstract = {Complex network response to node loss is a central question in different fields of network science because node failure can cause the fragmentation of the network, thus compromising the system functioning. Previous studies considered binary networks where the intensity (weight) of the links is not accounted for, i.e. a link is either present or absent. However, in real-world networks the weights of connections, and thus their importance for network functioning, can be widely different. Here, we analyzed the response of real-world and model networks to node loss accounting for link intensity and the weighted structure of the network. We used both classic binary node properties and network functioning measure, introduced a weighted rank for node importance (node strength), and used a measure for network functioning that accounts for the weight of the links (weighted efficiency). We find that: (i) the efficiency of the attack strategies changed using binary or weighted network functioning measures, both for real-world or model networks; (ii) in some cases, removing nodes according to weighted rank produced the highest damage when functioning was measured by the weighted efficiency; (iii) adopting weighted measure for the network damage changed the efficacy of the attack strategy with respect the binary analyses. Our results show that if the weighted structure of complex networks is not taken into account, this may produce misleading models to forecast the system response to node failure, i.e. consider binary links may not unveil the real damage induced in the system. Last, once weighted measures are introduced, in order to discover the best attack strategy, it is important to analyze the network response to node loss using nodes rank accounting the intensity of the links to the node.},

We consider both binary-topological and weighted network approaches by elucidating how links/nodes removal affect the spreading of information in real social networks. We show that to investigate the response of social network subjected to links/nodes removal can be useful to manage many important practical problems. This mini-review outlines that to perform more real and precise prediction of social networks response to links/nodes removal it is necessary to account the heterogeneity in link weights. Eventually, we propose promising lines for future researches in social network science.},

The proposal is based on the study of the shocks propagation along the patterns of connections among nodes.

  abstract = {In most European congested urban areas the rail tracks of the 19th and 20th century serving locations of industry and goods stations were removed, transformed for public passenger transport, closed down or used for other purposes. The main reasons might be the de-industrialisation of the inner cities and the centralisation of the supply-sector (wholesale markets, shopping centres). Simultaneous the urban areas got an excellent road network on the surface and an efficient public transport system in the underground or on dedicated tracks. Nevertheless the amount of goods delivered to urban areas increased due to material prosperity. In this context ``METRO.FREIGHT.2020'' analysed the possibilities of a reinforced utilisation of railway infrastructure for freight transport on the first and the last miles within the urban regions in Austria as exemplified in case studies for the metropolitan Region of Vienna, the agglomerations of Graz and Linz and for the urbanised Rhine-Valley in Vorarlberg. In this context the focus point of consideration was the interface of transport and urban development, to a lesser extent the theoretical approach behind. As a fundamental milestone a cadastre of existing or recoverable sidings or other rail shipping points has been surveyed. They were evaluated in respect of serviceability concerning tracking freight trains in the rail network and extensibility in the service area which was complemented with propositions for further developing. The recommendations focus measures intending technically and economically operable access points to rail net on one hand and potentially appropriate access points for the future. But, to reach this goal more strengthened integration of commercial location policy and of shippers' transport demands with a coordinated land use planning and an infrastructure development policy is required. Finally the methodical approach elaborated comprises following components to push more rail freight shipping:{$\bullet$}Traffic zoning is a hierarchical spatial approach subdividing an urban region in sectors, zones and `agglomerates' as spheres of activity for political and private actors involved in freight traffic generation and infrastructure affaires.{$\bullet$}Surveying a multimodal topology of infrastructure network which integrates all transport modes in its layout of freight infrastructure propped up on a public platform of a multimodal network graph in future.{$\bullet$}Characterizing an `agglomerate' typology of shipping sites with affinity to rail which describes the typical initial position and development trends of the freight transport inducing traffic zones.{$\bullet$}Shaping spatial structures which consist of super structures of shipping industrial sites as traffic generators, the infrastructure with its capacity for freight movements and the `metastructure' as external affected settlements and land uses are prime targets and intervention objects, the coordinated measures have to be allocated to. The railway operators are called on to offer more flexible train and operation forms tailored to the logistics of shippers if the rail infrastructure within the serving area from the consolidation node to the sidings enables it. In the end three scenarios have been identified, namely a scenario of ultimate displacement of rail freight service in towns, a retarding scenario which brakes the retreat of rail connected with a change of paradigm in transport and traffic planning leading into an offensive scenario of `clean freight mobility' to revitalize and extend rail freight operations into areas of high consumption.},

Transport networks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees, i.e., loopless. However, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein, including the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks: resilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks are closed. We find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the optimum state.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis is used widely in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering. The social network perspective focuses on relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research, which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field.},

  abstract = {This paper explores and analyzes resilience measures in network systems from different perspectives, which is beneficial to maintain the function of the whole networks. Few papers study resilience by using intermediate indicators. They straightly correlate resilience with basic entities, ignoring the modularized impact. Furthermore, some literatures do not further explain how nodes and edges play different roles in affecting network resilience. In this paper, resilience measures are proposed from perspective of various network-related elements, including the node and edge indicators in the network system. Through analyzing the characteristics of nodes and edges during failure, the matrices of node resilience and edge resilience are structured. Then, by processing and iterating two types of matrices, the resilience of the entire network is measured. The effect of node resilience and edge resilience on the network system is discussed. Our results show that node-related and edge-related indicators are both suitable to measure local stability. Besides, nodes always have a greater influence on network resilience than edges. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the rationality of the proposed measures.},
