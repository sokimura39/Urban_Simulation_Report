  abstract = {In this mini-review we discuss the problem of links/nodes removal in real social networks. We resume findings from works that adopted the two most common measure of network robustness, i.e. the largest connected component (LCC) and the network efficiency (Eff). We consider both binary-topological and weighted network approaches by elucidating how links/nodes removal affect the spreading of information in real social networks. We show that to investigate the response of social network subjected to links/nodes removal can be useful to manage many important practical problems. This mini-review outlines that to perform more real and precise prediction of social networks response to links/nodes removal it is necessary to account the heterogeneity in link weights. Eventually, we propose promising lines for future researches in social network science.},

  abstract = {Networks are at the core of modeling many engineering contexts, mainly in the case of infrastructures and communication systems. The resilience of a network, which is the property of the system capable of absorbing external shocks, is then of paramount relevance in the applications. This paper deals with this topic by advancing a theoretical proposal for measuring the resilience of a network. The proposal is based on the study of the shocks propagation along the patterns of connections among nodes. The theoretical model is tested on the real-world instances of two important airport systems in the US air traffic network: Illinois (including the hub of Chicago) and New York states (with JFK airport).},

  abstract = {Leaf venation is a pervasive example of a complex biological network, endowing leaves with a transport system and mechanical resilience. Transport networks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees, i.e., loopless. However, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein, including the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks: resilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks are closed. We find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the optimum state.},

The measure is illustrated and compared with respect to the standard centrality measures by using a classic network data set. The statistical distribution of information centrality is investigated by considering large computer generated graphs and two networks from the real world.},

Unlike the standard betweenness centrality measure which takes into account only the shortest paths between the nodes of given network, our, so-called {$\Delta$}-betweenness centrality measure is based on short paths between the nodes. We present an efficient algorithm for computing this measure and show experimental results supporting the importance of newly defined measure.},

  abstract = {This paper explores and analyzes resilience measures in network systems from different perspectives, which is beneficial to maintain the function of the whole networks. Few papers study resilience by using intermediate indicators. They straightly correlate resilience with basic entities, ignoring the modularized impact. Furthermore, some literatures do not further explain how nodes and edges play different roles in affecting network resilience. In this paper, resilience measures are proposed from perspective of various network-related elements, including the node and edge indicators in the network system. Through analyzing the characteristics of nodes and edges during failure, the matrices of node resilience and edge resilience are structured. Then, by processing and iterating two types of matrices, the resilience of the entire network is measured. The effect of node resilience and edge resilience on the network system is discussed. Our results show that node-related and edge-related indicators are both suitable to measure local stability. Besides, nodes always have a greater influence on network resilience than edges. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the rationality of the proposed measures.},
